If you're an artist looking to build a portfolio site, you've probably considered using [Cargo](https://cargo.site/). Its minimalist themes and UI are great for showcasing visual art easily. However, it can be pricey and limiting - especially compared to hosting your own WordPress site.

I made [Jess](https://jessfauscette.com/), a minimalist WordPress Theme for art portfolios, so that artists can save money and have more control over their sites. The theme is built on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), a bare-bones starter template, and uses WordPress's built in [Masonry Grid](https://artisansweb.net/add-masonry-grid-layout-wordpress/) to organize art on the homepage.

To use the theme to its full potential, I recommend the following plugins:

[Easy Add Thumbnail](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) - Sets the featured image of each post to the first image automatically.

[Fonts Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/olympus-google-fonts/) - Easily set fonts using Google Fonts.

[Simple Custom Post Order](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-post-order/) - Drag and drop posts to desired order.

Also, be sure to remove all default widgets through Appearance > Widgets.
